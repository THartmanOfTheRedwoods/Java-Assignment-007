# More Arrays and References - Java Assignment 7

**Instructions:**
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch named Feature01.

## Part 1: Array Exploration take 2

**Objective:**
The purpose of this section is to practice writing more methods to use arrays.

1. Two words are anagrams if they contain **the same letters** AND **the same number of each letter**. For example, "stop" is an anagram of "pots", "allen downey" is an anagram of "well annoyed", and "christopher mayfield" is an anagram of "hi prof the camel is dry".
    * Write a method that takes 2 strings and checks whether they are anagrams of each other.
    * HINT: The lab's histogram method may be helpful.

## Submission
Follow these steps for submission:
1. Create a Feature01 branch of your code if you haven't already.
2. Commit your working code for the exercises to your local copy/Feature01 branch.
3. Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e., GitHub: Feature01 -> origin/Feature01).
4. Issue a Pull request to my instructor repo.
5. **Make sure to COPY the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment in Canvas.**
